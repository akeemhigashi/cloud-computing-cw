# Cloud Computing Coursework

## Overview

This is the coursework project for the Cloud Computing module (2025/26).  
It demonstrates the use of cloud-native principles to build, deploy, and manage a Node.js-based web application, focusing on:

- Cloud storage and file upload
- Use of Docker containers
- Deployment automation using GitHub Actions
- Interaction with GCP services (e.g. Cloud Storage, Compute Engine)
- Infrastructure as code using Terraform

The project is developed as part of the practical assessment and reflects individual work.
